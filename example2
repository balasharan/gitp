Why Learn it?
Git was one of the things I was scared of when I was learning how to code- mostly due to my irrational fear of the command line. Instead, I used GitHub Desktop which allowed me to lazily drag and drop files. However when I was hired in my first tech role, I soon realized how essential it was to be acquainted with using Git in the terminal. It's an essential part of our everyday lives as developer to use it!
